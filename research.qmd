For my undergraduate thesis, I studied the potential to create jet fuel from forestry residue to reduce emissions from air travel. Advised by [Dr. Eric Larson](https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/experts/eric-larson), I modeled a pathway for converting forestry residue to bio-jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, then evaluated the economics and potential for scale-up. You can read more about that project [here](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01q524jr60r).
