I’m currently a 3rd semester PhD student at Colorado State University working with Dr. Keith Paustian. My research focuses on the co-location of regenerative cattle grazing and solar PV to reduce land-use tension between energy and agriculture and improve environmental outcomes of renewable energy. When I’m not in the field or the lab, I’m usually trail running, backpacking, or playing in the mountains. Thanks for stopping by!"

Advised by Dr. Eric Larson, I modeled a pathway for converting forestry residue to bio-jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, then evaluated the economics and potential for scale-up. You can read more about that project here."
