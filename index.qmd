## Hello!

I'm a soil scientist interested in how we can make the best land management decisions possible for soil carbon sequestration, climate resilience and ecosystem function. I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student at Colorado State University working with [Dr. Keith Paustian](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-soilcrop/faculty/keith-paustian/). My research focuses on the co-location of regenerative cattle grazing and solar PV to reduce land-use tension between energy and agriculture and improve environmental outcomes of renewable energy. When I'm not in the field or the lab, I'm usually trail running, backpacking, or playing in the mountains. Thanks for stopping by!
